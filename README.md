A collaborative real-time local-first global canvas.

This project is a demonstration of the family of the Dart-native libraries based on [crdt](https://github.com/cachapa/crdt) and the WebSocket-based synchronization layer [crdt_sync](https://github.com/cachapa/crdt_sync).

The project is composed of a Flutter-based client optimized for the web, and a simple server that acts as a central orchestrator.
